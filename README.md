# Finance_Analytics of AtliQ Hardware
Welcome to the AtliQ Hardware Data Analytics Project Repository. In this project I have used MySQL to generate insightful reports.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware is a company that sells computer hardwares to clients which has several branches throughout India. AtliQ Hardware emerged as the first indigeneous manufacturers of computer peripherals in India. As a result their sales and revenue increased every year. As the size of excel files continues to grow, it is encountering performance issues, causing them to become unresponsive and stopped working. To adress this challenge AtliQ Harware hired aa team of data analysts who will use MySQL as their database management system and to extract valuable insights from the data. These insights will empower our company to make more informed and strategic decisions, ultimately optimizing our operations and performance.
